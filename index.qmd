## Dependencies {#sec-dependencies .unnumbered}

This is a quarto book project and R package dependencies are managed through the `renv` package. All packages and their versions can be viewed in the lockfile `renv.lock`. All required packages and the appropriate versions can be installed by running the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
renv::restore(repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest")
```
